		<p>I'm from Illinois originally, a small town on the Mississippi river called Moline. It's home to John Deere and a terrible place which is why I ended up here.  I came to KC right after high school to attend KCAI.  After that I attended  UMKC and recieved a BA in Art History (another degree that is useless for me). I love Art and Music and play several instruments, I even toured around the mid-west in a Devo coverband as well a B-52's band, both bands were most hated in Wichita. I currently live in Armor Fields in KC with my wife Lindsay, daughter Elise, new baby by Harrison, as well as two cats sent straight from Hell.  I've been managing a Bar for the last 12 years and the late hours leave something to be desired.  I'm attending this program in hopes of starting a new career in a new field with more reasonable hours.</p>
